- We will start of with setting up our development environment and downloading all the dependencies. The tech stack we will be using today is - Hardhat, Alchemy, Pinata, React and Ethers.js
- We will then use the openzepellin library’s ERC721 smart contract, and inherit it to create our own NFT smart contract called Collection.sol
- After that we will need to deploy our smart contract using ethers.js and check our deployment on etherscan.
- Once all the solidity part is done, we’ll make a very simple react frontend for our website.
- This webpage will be able to list 5 NFTs, a user would be able to connect to their metamask and mint any 2 of these NFTs.
- And that’s it, you will now be able to see and enjoy your NFT in your own metamask wallet!
